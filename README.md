A technical test for reading movies from themoviedb.org. Files will be commented for explanation reasons where necessary. The application has been produced for mobile first, and would be further expanded for desktop support in the future. Additionally, here we will be using our api key directly in the code; in a real world example this would likely be behind our own server for security reasons.


# Project Structure

  

All the source files can be found under `/src`. All Elm files live under `/src/elm`, other assets such as sass files live under `/src/assets`. CSS has been created under the SMACSS structure, and following BEM class notation.

All tests can be found under `/tests`

All custom webpack loaders can be found under `/loaders`. See the loader file for comments on why we're using a custom loader.

All distribution files can be found under `/dist`

  

# Building from Source

  

* Ensure that [Elm is installed](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html). This would be included as an npm dev dependency, however Elm 0.19 has not yet had a release on npm as of yet. If you're new to Elm, feel free to read https://guide.elm-lang.org/ for a quick overview.

* Run `npm i` or `yarn` in the root folder

* Run any of the following in the root folder (feel free to substitute `yarn` for `npm run`)

	* Running `yarn dev` will compile a new unoptimized app.js in dist with elm set to debug mode

	* Running `yarn serve` will start a devserver that watches for changes on localhost:8080 (if available) running an unoptimized debug build

	* Running `yarn prod` will create an optimized production build in dist

  

# Running Tests

  

* Run `npm i` or `yarn` in the root folder if you have not already done so

* Run `npx elm-test` or `yarn elm-test` in the root folder
